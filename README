# THE BAN GAME

The Ban Game is a text-based game that can be played in the Twitch chat.

Users in chat can compete each other casting the spell "BAN" to ban other
players from the game and dominate the chat!

## Installation

This program requires:
 - python3
 - pipenv

And the following python modules:
 - requests
 - twitchio

Example (tested on Ubuntu 21.04):

  $ sudo apt install python3 pipenv
  $ pipenv run pip3 install twitchio
  $ pipenv run pip3 install requests

## Running the game

The game engine is implemented by a bot, to start the game you simply use the
script run.sh in Linux:

  $ ./run.sh
  Loading .env environment variablesâ€¦

## Rules

 - any PLAYER in chat can run:
   !ban <TARGET_PLAYER>

   <PLAYER> deals <N> "BAN" damage to <TARGET_PLAYER>, where <N> is randomly
   modeled as a D20 roll:

   - a roll of 1 is always a MISS

   - a roll of 20 is a critical hit and it does x2 damage (=40 damage)

   - <PLAYER> gets (1 + 10-25% of the damage back (to prevent spamming !ban)

 - each <PLAYER> starts with an initial health pool of 50 HP

   - when PLAYER runs the !ban command we initialize the health pool for
     <PLAYER> and <TARGET_PLAYER>

 - a PLAYER can run a command !life to show in chat the amount of HP left

 - when a PLAYER reaches 0 HP, the PLAYER is banned and cannot run the !ban
   command until PLAYER is resurrected

 - !unban <TARGET_PLAYER> heals <TARGET_PLAYER> to full health
   (this command can be only ran by broadcaster or mods)

## TODO

 - higher health pool for privileged users (mods, VIPs, etc.)

 - implement an additional cooldown for the !ban command in addition to the
   damage backfire to prevent spamming ban even more

 - you can get health back over time or if you chat (like +1 HP every 30 min
   being active in chat or similar)
